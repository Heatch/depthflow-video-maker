story = """In a world of change, our mindset is our greatest asset. Imagine two paths: one fixed, one ever-expanding. The fixed path seems safe, but growth leads to fulfillment. Challenges aren't roadblocks—they're stepping stones. When we stumble, we learn to dance with uncertainty. Our abilities aren't set; they're like clay, shaped by experiences. "I can't do it" becomes "I can't do it yet."

Think of your mind as a garden: a fixed mindset is concrete; a growth mindset is fertile soil. Efforts and challenges are like water and sunlight to this garden. Embrace "yet" in every part of life. Haven't mastered a skill? You haven't mastered it yet. These 'yets' aren't failures—they're promises of future success. Feedback isn't criticism; it's a gift. When others succeed, don't envy them—learn from them. Their success illuminates your path.

Persistence sculpts your abilities. Curiosity guides you through uncharted knowledge. Failure isn't a fall but a chance to pivot and grow. Every expert started as a beginner who didn't give up. Your potential isn't a fixed destination but an ever-expanding horizon. Challenges fuel determination, not defeat. Celebrate growth—it's the journey where we come alive.

With a growth mindset, every day is a chance to become a better version of yourself. You aren't defined by today but by who you strive to be tomorrow. Believe in your dreams and the power of growth. Remember, in your life's story, you are both protagonist and author. Your potential is limitless, your future bright. Embrace the power of 'yet' and open the doors to possibility."""
